## Description

This repository contains implementations of several algorithms for removing striping noise in hyperspectral data. The algorithms were reproduced using Matlab and C++, and their effectiveness was compared on test data.



## Algorithms

- Two classical TV-based: TV, UTV
- Two HTV-based: ASSTV, SSTV
- Four Low-rank-based: LRMR, LRTV, 3DTNN, 3DLogTNN
- Two Double-low-rank-based: DLR, ATVDLR
